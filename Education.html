    <ul>
        <li> Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from which he graduated. Musk applied for a Canadian passport 
        through his Canadian-born mother, knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way. While waiting for his application to be processed, 
        he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.</li>

        <li> Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill. In 1990, he entered 
        Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where he completed studies for a Bachelor of 
        Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School. Although Musk claims he earned the degrees in 1995, 
        UPenn maintains it awarded them in 1997. He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic 
        book-scanning service similar to <a href="https://books.google.com/">Google Books.</a></li>

        <li> In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at the energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for 
        energy storage, and another at the Palo Altoâ€“based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials science at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">
        Stanford University.</a> However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, instead dropping out two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly 
        never received a response.</li>
